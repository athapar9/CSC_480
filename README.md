### Purpose

This is a project for Rodrigo Canaan's Artificial Intelligence (CSC 480) class. This project aims to help users with their personal style by proposing an AI-generated Personal Styling Assistant. By utilizing natural language processing and image recognition technologies, the system will offer tailored fashion recommendations, considering individual preferences, body types, and current trends. Our goal is to enhance the personal styling industry by creating a unique and personalized experience for all users.
